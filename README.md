# liftosaur2garmin

Sync Liftosaur workouts to Garmin Connect by converting Liftosaur history records into strength-training FIT files and uploading them to Garmin.

## What It Does

- Fetches workout history from Liftosaur with a personal API key
- Parses Liftosaur workout text into exercises, sets, reps, weights, and warmups
- Uses a Garmin FIT mapping and upload pipeline for Garmin Connect
- Supports CLI sync and the FastAPI dashboard flow

## Requirements

- A Liftosaur premium subscription with API access
- A Garmin Connect account
- Python 3.10+
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for environment and dependency management

## Setup From Scratch

Clone the repo, create a virtual environment, activate it, and install the project itself:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Why install with `-e ".[dev]"` instead of `-r requirements.txt`?

- `requirements.txt` installs dependencies only
- `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"` installs the `liftosaur2garmin` package and creates the `liftosaur2garmin` command in `.venv/bin/`

Check that the command exists:

```bash
which liftosaur2garmin
liftosaur2garmin --help
```

If you do not want to activate the virtual environment, you can run the CLI with either of these forms:

```bash
.venv/bin/liftosaur2garmin --help
.venv/bin/python -m liftosaur2garmin.cli --help
```

## Credentials And Config

Create a Liftosaur API key in the Liftosaur app:

1. Open Liftosaur
2. Go to `Settings`
3. Open `API Keys`
4. Create a key and copy it

The app can read credentials from:

- `~/.liftosaur2garmin/config.json`
- Environment variables
- CLI flags
- The web setup page

The main environment variables are:

- `LIFTOSAUR_API_KEY`
- `GARMIN_EMAIL`
- `GARMIN_AUTH_WORKER_BASE_URL`
- `L2G_PASSWORD`

`GARMIN_PASSWORD` is optional. It is still accepted for direct local CLI login, but the primary flow is to connect Garmin once and reuse the saved token file.

`GARMIN_AUTH_WORKER_BASE_URL` is optional. Set it on hosted deployments after you deploy the Cloudflare Worker in [worker-di](./worker-di). When it is present, the hosted setup page can connect to Garmin directly, including 2FA.

`L2G_PASSWORD` is optional. When set, the dashboard requires that password before showing pages or running API actions. When unset, dashboard auth is disabled.

Example:

```bash
LIFTOSAUR_API_KEY="your-liftosaur-api-key"
GARMIN_EMAIL="you@example.com"
L2G_PASSWORD="choose-a-dashboard-password"
```

If a `.env` file exists in your working directory, the app loads it automatically.

If you want the variables exported into your shell session as well, load it like this:

```bash
set -a
source .env
set +a
```

The local bootstrap flow is the simplest path for most users:

```bash
liftosaur2garmin init
```

That command:

- saves app settings to `~/.liftosaur2garmin/config.json`
- performs Garmin login on your own machine
- prompts for an MFA code if Garmin requests one
- writes the Garmin token file to `~/.garminconnect/garmin_tokens.json`

You can also use the dashboard for the same local flow:

```bash
liftosaur2garmin serve
```

Then open the local setup page and use `Connect Garmin`.

Hosted deployments use local bootstrap too. Connect Garmin locally first, then upload the exported token file in the hosted setup page.

If `GARMIN_AUTH_WORKER_BASE_URL` is configured on the hosted app, the setup page can also connect Garmin directly:

- enter Garmin email and password on the hosted setup page
- if Garmin requires 2FA, enter the 6-digit code inline
- if Garmin rejects the direct login, the page reveals a browser sign-in fallback and keeps token-file upload as a backup path

The Garmin token file can be exported with:

```bash
liftosaur2garmin export-garmin-token
```

## CLI

```bash
liftosaur2garmin init
liftosaur2garmin sync
liftosaur2garmin list
liftosaur2garmin status
liftosaur2garmin unmapped
liftosaur2garmin export-garmin-token
liftosaur2garmin serve
```

You can still pass credentials as flags for one-off local runs:

```bash
liftosaur2garmin sync \
  --liftosaur-api-key "$LIFTOSAUR_API_KEY" \
  --garmin-email "$GARMIN_EMAIL"
```

If you want the CLI to attempt a fresh local Garmin login instead of reusing saved tokens, you can also add:

```bash
liftosaur2garmin sync \
  --liftosaur-api-key "$LIFTOSAUR_API_KEY" \
  --garmin-email "$GARMIN_EMAIL" \
  --garmin-password "$GARMIN_PASSWORD"
```

## First Run

One clean way to get started is:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
export LIFTOSAUR_API_KEY="your-liftosaur-api-key"
liftosaur2garmin init
liftosaur2garmin export-garmin-token
liftosaur2garmin list
liftosaur2garmin sync --dry-run
```

## Tests

```bash
UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache uv run pytest -q
```

Worker tests:

```bash
node --test worker-di/index.test.js
```

## Acknowledgements

This project builds on the open-source work in [`drkostas/hevy2garmin`](https://github.com/drkostas/hevy2garmin) by Konstantinos Georgiou. Liftosaur integration targets the REST API documented at [liftosaur.com/doc/api](https://www.liftosaur.com/doc/api).

## Notes

- The Liftosaur client normalizes history records into the workout structure expected by the existing Garmin sync pipeline.
- Exercise mapping includes compatibility logic for Liftosaur-style names such as `Bench Press, Barbell`.
- Hosted Garmin login can run through the repo-owned Cloudflare Worker in [worker-di](./worker-di). Without `GARMIN_AUTH_WORKER_BASE_URL`, hosted setup falls back to token-file import from a local `init` or `serve` flow.
